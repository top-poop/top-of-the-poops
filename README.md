Website: [top-of-the-poops.org](https://top-of-the-poops.org)

Seems that [#sewage](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23sewage) is on people's minds right now.

The UK publishes some information about sewage outfalls - here are some scripts to get this information, analyse it, and
perhaps publish some interesting findings.

## Maps

We previously used mapbox but after getting very popular we couldn't afford it anymore!
Maps now rendered ourselves, but it's not going to be as fast as MapBox.

We use [TileServer GL](https://github.com/maptiler/tileserver-gl) in combination with a UK Vector map
from [MapTiler](https://www.maptiler.com/data/)


## How to use

You can clone the repo - I use IntelliJ IDEA to make a hot-reloading web page. 
The build runs locally with `make watch`

All data files are generated on developer machine, only the javascript build runs on CI. This ensures the CI build is acceptably fast.
Currently it runs in about 10 seconds. Which is OK, could be faster.

`make watch` uses inotify - this may not work on MacOS.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome - especially CSS / Javascript improvements! But please chat before doing any real work - to make sure everyone is aligned with direction. 

### Development Environment

This has been developed on Linux, the makefiles may or may not work on a Mac.

### Pre-requisites

**Ensure you have python3 venv installed**:

```shell
sudo apt install python3.10-venv
```

**Install GDAL/OGR packages**:

https://mothergeo-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/how-to/gdal-ubuntu-pkg.html

**Install  mdbtools**:

```shell
apt-get install mdbtools
```

**Start the PostgreSQL database**:

```shell
docker compose up
```

_If you have postgreSQL installed, you may need to stop your postgreSQL service_

### Setting up the database

```shell
make python
cd db/data
make load-all
```

### Generating json data files

You'll need to have set up the database stuff first

```shell
make generated
```


### React

Why is there a React app per page? 
Because it makes it easy to write the software

2020 - Can't find! - Partial information at: https://www.dwrcymru.com/en/our-services/wastewater/combined-storm-overflows/valleys-and-south-east-wales

2021 - Main page: https://www.dwrcymru.com/en/our-services/wastewater/river-water-quality/combined-storm-overflows
2021 - Seems to be split over 3 files (with different formats), unknown overlap with Environment Agency data.

### Software

You'll need the following:

- python3
- libreoffice
- gdal-bin

# Things to do

- Link with voting results - need to find the division results...
- Rivers and beaches by constituency?
- Constituency page showing all the things by constituency?


# Data Quality

To be sure the quality of the data is unbelievably poor. Perhaps it is so poor so that it is hard to understand?

## 2021 Data

### Issues
 - Distributed as an Excel file, which is hard to process
   - Should ideally be a machine readable format. I'll say simple XML, with schema, but a consistent CSV file would be OK.
 - Mix and match of data types 
   - Numeric columns have "N/A", "#N/A", and "#NA"
   - Name columns have "0" in
   - Percentage values scale from 0-1 in some sheets, and 0-100 in others, because some sheets have cells set to "Numeric", and others to "Percent"
 - Continuation rows
   - A few of the sheets don't stick to "one row per record", which is kinda mandatory in a machine readable file.
 - Inconsistent data
   - Particularly consent ids don't match consent ids in the consent database - the formatting differs
   - Consent ids don't have a consistent format.
   - Loads of EDM rows don't match valid consents. 
 - Duplicate data rows 
   - Some data rows are duplicates in many of the source files. It is not clear why, it looks like an extract from a database upstream has maybe repeated rows where there are multiple assets with the same consent information?
 - Wales data is spread over multiple files, with different formats, and may or may not overlap with EA data.


### Noted Improvements
 - The files are now tabs in a single document with *almost* consistent data across the tabs.

### Example Duplicate Data

```
'Anglian Water', 'DAVENTRY SEWER SYSTEM', 'AW5NF181', 'A1'
'Dwr Cymru Welsh Water', '#TBC', '#N/A', '', '', '', '0.25', '1', '100', ''
'Severn Trent Water', 'WITTON - GEORGE ROAD XXX (CSO)', 'TBC', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''
'South West Water', 'KINGSAND SEWAGE PUMPING STATION', '301903', 'A1', '', 'KINGSAND BEACH', '33.72', '21', '100', ''
```
